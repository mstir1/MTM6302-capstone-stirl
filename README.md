Pokedex

The color scheme was created based off the established colors that pokemon is associated with. On the back of a Pokemon card you see the colors of white, red, and blue so I designed the website with this in mind. The buttons were included as a shortcut to skip to a certain generation and on the iphone it is on the top and bottom of the screen, this is to make sure there isn't so much on a small screen. Each pokedex entry includes the discription of the pokemon. I used the font called Daydream for the header and I put a pokeball on the side and used a red and blue gradient.
